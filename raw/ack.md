This website was created by Kailaash (kai), Shevonne (owl) and Ying Ying (y^2^) for their **PC5132 module project.** It is targeted at students with a **rudimentary understanding of nuclear physics** (basically A-level physics students?) and aims to shed light (haha) on exactly what the website title suggests.
