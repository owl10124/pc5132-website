# Heavy element formation

**Heavy elements** refer to elements **heavier than Fe-56.** These are formed through the following three types of nucleosynthesis: **r-process, s-process and p-process.**

## R-process (rapid neutron-capture process)

R-process, or **rapid neutron-capture process,** is the **primary** process that results in the formation of heavy elements. It is capable of forming **transuranic elements,** which are elements with atomic numbers **larger than 92** ($^{238}_{92}U$). The resulting nuclei formed are known as **r-nuclei**, whose abundance distribution shows **peaks** at mass numbers **80, 130 and 195.** 

The r-process starts off with a **heavy seed nucleus** (Fe-56 or heavier) capturing neutrons rapidly. The rapid capture of neutrons (hence the name of the process) means that the neutrons are being added to the nucleus at a **faster** rate than that of **beta-decay,** resulting in the formation of a **neutron-rich** nucleus. This will occur until the nucleus reaches the **“waiting point”**, which occurs at the **neutron drip line,** when **no more neutrons can be added** to the nucleus. At this point, **binding energy** is positive. 

The nucleus then undergoes **beta-decay** and the neutrons are converted into protons and electrons. This increases its **atomic number,** thus increasing the **charge** on the nuclei and the **value** of the neutron-drip line. Therefore, the nuclei are able to **capture more neutrons,** repeating the process. 

This leads to the formation of very **neutron-rich radioactive nuclei** that will eventually beta-decay towards the **valley of beta stability.** The r-process is terminated when the resulting nuclei become **too unstable** for neutron capture to occur, resulting in **nuclear fission** instead.

R-process occurs in **high-entropy environments** with high densities of neutrons, around $10^{26}$ neutrons ($\approx200g$) per cm^3^. Thus, it is believed to occur during **core-collapse supernovae** and **neutron-star mergers.**

## S-process (slow neutron-capture process)

S-process, also known as **slow neutron-capture process,** is a **secondary** process which requires **pre-existing heavy isotopes** as seed nuclei. As the name suggests, it is characterised by the slow capture of neutrons: here neutron capture occurs **slower** than **beta decay.**

After a neutron capture, beta decay will occur until the isotope is **stable.** Similar to r-process, s-process results in the formation of **neutron-rich nuclei.** However, these nuclei are **less neutron-rich** than those formed in the r-process, and they are found in the **valley of beta stability.** Also, these nuclei will increase in mass **1 unit at a time,** unlike r-process, which will result in formation of nuclei **much heavier** than seed nuclei.

Unlike r-process, s-process is known to occur mainly in **asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,** where the **neutron flux** is sufficient for the slow capture.

## P-process

As the r- and s-processes form **neutron-rich** nuclei, they are **unable** to synthesise the 35 rare **proton-rich isotopes** known as **p-nuclei.** This is where **p-process** comes into play. 

In contrast to the earlier two processes mentioned, the p-process is responsible for the production of proton-rich isotopes of heavy elements. While the mechanism is **not fully understood,** one possible method is through **proton capture.** This involves the capture of an incoming proton by seed nuclei. One such process is the **rp-process,** which stands for **rapid proton capture process.** Similar to r-process, this involves the **capture of protons** at a rate **much faster than beta decay,** resulting in proton-rich nuclei. 

However, due to the **increase in charge** of the nuclei, causing **increased repulsion** for the next proton (via Coulomb's law), this process is **not very efficient** compared to the r-process and s-process. As a result, we observe **fewer neutron-deficient** heavy nuclei compared to **neutron-rich** heavy nuclei. 

A more plausible mechanism for the p-process is **photodisintegration.** It involves **seed nuclei absorbing** a **high energy photon,** causing the nucleus to **eject** a **subatomic particle,** which is a **proton, neutron, or alpha particle.** The disintegration process is thought to occur in the **O/Ne-rich zone** of a massive star undergoing a **Type II supernova explosion.** As the **supernova shock** heats matter **less** as it moves out through the stellar radius, the **innermost parts** are **heated more** than the outermost parts. Thus, **lighter** p-nuclei are made in the innermost parts due to **increased melting** while the heavier p-nuclei are found in the outermost parts.
