# Preamble

There are many elements in the universe [citation needed]. Here's a table of them!

But we mostly start out with hydrogen, and a little helium. These are tiny and light elements.

So how do we get big elements?

Well, we squeeze the tiny ones together *really hard.*

## Recap: what are atoms and how do they work?

Most relevant parts of our physical reality are made of atoms/ions, right? Tiny **nuclei** made of nucleons: **protons** (positively charged) and **neutrons** (uncharged), where larger / heavier elements have **more** nucleons.

And a big surrounding cloud of very light **electrons** (negatively charged). 

This is stable primarily because of two forces:

1. **Coulomb force:** your standard electrostatic nonsense, which **pushes protons apart:** $F=\frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}$, and

2. **Nuclear force (residual strong force):** which acts on particles only when they're **really close.** At $r<0.7\text{fm}$ it's repulsive; at $0.7\text{fm}<r<2.0\text{fm}$ it's attractive; at $r>2.0\text{fm}$ it's quite negligible.

   > This… somehow has to do with the strong interaction between quarks, which individually have a certain property (called colour charge), but when they come together to form nucleons it 'cancels out'. So the '*residual* strong force' is just due to interactions between these quarks, and is only really relevant at tiny scales.

   Understandably, this is not easy to quantify, and models are mostly empirical :/

Graph.

We quantify this using **binding energy:** the **work that must be done** to break a nucleus into nucleons. Specifically, the **average binding energy per nucleon.** (The energy is converted to **mass** by $E=\Delta mc^2$ so the nucleus is slightly **lighter** than its constituents.)

For small nuclei, this **increases** with nucleon number: nuclear force dominates; there are more existing nucleons to attract it.

For bigger nuclei, this **decreases** with nucleon number: electromagnetic force dominates; nuclear force is 'less effective' due to increased radius.

Graph.

(Where the total binding energy is the **area** of the rectangle from (0,0).)

As such, each element has a number of **stable isotopes** which lie in that sweet spot where the nucleus *doesn't* kill itself. **Higher** binding energy means more **stable** nuclei, where the peaks here are things like **iron** ($Fe^{56}_{26},~Fe^{58}_{26}$) and **nickel** ($Ni^{62}_{28}$).

### Nuclear fusion

What happens to unstable nuclei which *don't* go to psychiatrists, then? They tend to forcefully make themselves stable and release energy through **fission** and **fusion** (pretty self-explanatory names). We're only worried about fusion here: you combine / fuse (haha) two or more atomic nuclei, forming larger nuclei! This generally happens for elements on the **left** of the curve,

so the product is *more* stable.

Graph.

Nuclei are **positively charged** and really don't like coming together (because Coulomb), so a high 'activation energy' is required (typically as **temperature**), until they get close enough and start releasing energy instead. The net **energy released** is still the **change in total binding energy**.

- For **small nuclei** this is quite positive, so energy is **released;** the reaction can **sustain itself.**
- For **big nuclei** this might be negative, so the reaction **consumes energy** instead, hence it doesn't happen much.

This process is how you get other elements!

## Stellar nucleosynthesis

is the process via which **stars** create **new atomic nuclei**. Lighter elements are made via **nuclear fusion,** while heavier ones have… other methods.

With that in mind, let's begin.
