## Molecular cloud

A molecular cloud is **an interstellar cloud of gas and dust in which molecules can form**, the most common of which is hydrogen ($H_2$).

## Open cluster

An **open cluster** is a type of [star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster) made of up to a few thousand [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that were formed from the same [giant molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_molecular_cloud) and have roughly the same age.<sup>~~[hmm, I wonder where this description came from?]~~</sup>

It consists of multiple **protostars,** which are **very young stars** that are still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud.

This is the **earliest phase** in the process of stellar evolution.

The process of **protostar formation** occurs as a result of gravity pulling together gases and dust (**accretion**) into a ball (**nebula**). Gravitational energy begins to heat these gases as they come closer to the centre, releasing radiation which simply escapes into space.

As the infalling gas depletes, the **protostar** forms a **pre-main-sequence star,** which **contracts** to form a main-sequence star.

## Brown dwarf

**Brown dwarfs** are **substellar** objects as they are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen into helium. Instead they rely on the fusion of **deuterium,** and sometimes even **lithium!** 

Brown dwarfs can appear in **different colors** to the naked eye, ranging from orange to possibly red at high temperatures, to magenta at low temperatures.

They may be **fully convective,** with no layers of chemical differentiation by depth.

### The explanation for the inability to sustain hydrogen fusion:

After the formation of the pre-main-sequence star, **thermonuclear fusion reactions** within the core of the star will support it against any further gravitational contraction. **Hydrostatic equilibrium** is reached and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing **hydrogen into helium** as a main-sequence star.

However, normal hydrogen thermonuclear fusion reactions are **unable to ignite the core** in brown dwarfs as they have less than $0.08M_\odot$ (solar masses). Gravitational contraction does not heat the small protostar effectively. Before it can reach a high enough temperature to trigger fusion, the density reaches the point where electrons **are too closely packed together** to create **quantum electron degeneracy pressure.** It is left to cool off radiating its internal energy out to space, i.e. it becomes a useless piece of mass. :(

## Low-mass star 

**Low-mass stars,** or stars under $8M_{\odot}$, are the smallest, coolest, and dimmest main sequence stars. These are usually orange, red, or brown in color, and are formed when nebulae are small (but not too small). They have **large convection zones** in comparison to massive stars.

Low-mass stars use up their **hydrogen** fuel (fuse it into **helium**) very **slowly**, and consequently have **long lives.** (A very good example would be our **Sun.**) While they **may not dominate** the **energy input** into the interstellar medium, they constitute **most of the total mass** in our galaxy.

## High-mass star

**High-mass stars,** or any stars over $8M_\odot$, are formed in large nebulae.

The **temperature, luminosity** and **duration** of the star's hydrogen expenditure is dependent upon its **mass.** A massive star will burn at an **extremely high temperature,** and be beautifully **luminous,** but at a cost of its **lifespan** as it only lasts for a **few million years.** This is very short in comparison to **smaller** stars that can exist for **billions of years.**

## Red giant

When the **hydrogen fuel** at the centre of a **low-mass star** is **exhausted,** nuclear reactions start to move **outwards** from the **core** into the **shell,** expending the hydrogen there instead. As a result, the **outside** of the star starts to **expand and cool,** turning much redder. The star becomes a **red giant,** about **400 times larger** than its original size.

As it expands, the red giant will **engulf** some of its **close-orbiting planets.** (For us, this means the Sun will engulf the planets of our solar system, including Earth. But that won't happen for another 5 billion years so we don't really need to care.)

Meanwhile, the **temperature and pressure** in its core start to **increase** again, which **improves conditions for fusion.** This time, its fuel becomes **helium.** But there **isn't much helium** in the core, so the star can only survive for **millions of years**. Eventually, the core runs out and it **repeats the process** of nuclear reactions.

Helium burns in the shell surrounding the core, while hydrogen may undergo fusion in the shell surrounding *that.*

This is when it enters its secondary red giant phase.

In this phase, it has 2 options. 

## Planetary nebula

These are **expanding, glowing shells** of **hot gas** cast off during the death of a low-mass star. Although they're named 'planetary nebulae', this has nothing to do with *actual planets:* they just *look* like small planets when observed through a telescope.

These are **highly unstable** and begin to **pulsate** once they leave the red giant phase, releasing **stellar winds** by **ejecting its outer layers.** As such they only survive for a **few ten thousand years**.

The remaining **core** begins to shine brightly as it is very hot, at about ${10^5}{^\circ C}$. The core ejects **ultraviolet light,** which causes the planetary nebula to start **glowing.**

## White dwarf

The **remaining core** after the planetary nebula ejects its outer layers is called a **white dwarf.** Made up of highly compressed **carbon and oxygen**, and **dense enough** that their mass is **comparable to the Sun,** these are thought to make up **6% of stars** in the known stars **neighbouring the Sun.**

Even though they have the **hottest temperature,** they are **far away** and hence **appear very faint.** However, they must rely solely on their internal energy to **maintain the heat and light** released. As such, over time, they **cool down** and **change colour.**

## Black dwarf

The result of the **long-term cooling** down of white dwarfs. Eventually, the cool and dark black dwarf will disappear from sight. 

## Binary white dwarf

The result of when a **red giant** interacts with a **white dwarf.** They start **orbiting** each other, radiating **gravitational waves,** and must come **closer together** to balance this loss of energy.

## Nova

The white dwarf **draws material (hydrogen)** from the red giant closer towards itself. 

That hydrogen **accretes onto the surface** of the white dwarf, forming a thin atmosphere. 

The white dwarf **heats the hydrogen,** until eventually the gas pressure is **high enough** to ignite **fusion.** Not just any fusion: rapid **runaway fusion.** This ignition forms **bright light** visible from Earth<sup>[kai pls confirm]</sup>, and the new hydrogen atmosphere is **expelled away** from the white dwarf into space. The star is *not* destroyed in the process.

In the past, astronomers thought these new bright lights were new stars, and the name "nova" stuck. This is an enormously energetic event, that produces not only **visible light,** but **gamma rays** and **x-rays** too. The end result is that some stars that could only be seen through a telescope can be seen **with the naked eye** during a nova.

The star can become a sole **white dwarf,** or can **reenter** the binary star system.

## Type Ia supernova

A **white dwarf** star pulls matter from a companion star until the dwarf’s dead core **re-ignites** in a thermonuclear explosion that **destroys the star.** This is similar to a nova but the explosion is much more powerful. A Type I supernova has **no hydrogen** in its spectrum. 

## Red supergiant

Similar to a **red giant,** but involving **massive stars** ($>8M_{\odot}$). Instead of stopping at **helium,** they continue on to **carbon** and so on all the way to **iron.** Eventually they can **no longer fuse** elements, and they end up with only **one option…**

## Type II supernova

The **core** of the red supergiant consists of mostly **just iron.** That means the **outward pull** of gravity **stops** as there is **no more fusion** of elements to produce energy. **Huge amounts of energy** are created during this process, allowing for the **formation of new elements** in the process. The **outer layers collapse** until it reaches the **iron core.** Since the core is **too dense,** the collapse of the outer layers will bounce off the surface at around **30000km/s,** sending **shockwaves** through the star. The star **explodes,** brightening quickly, gradually fading away leaving the core by itself. The core forms either a **neutron star** or a **black hole,** depending on the **mass of the remaining core.** 

## Black hole

The **gravity** is so strong that virtually nothing can escape it, even **light.** This makes it so that we **cannot see anything** in this location. 

However, we can see the effects of the black hole on the surrounding universe, where the gravity of the black hole pulls clouds, dust and stars towards it. Materials swirl and crash into one another, producing **heat and light.** This light can be observed as it is emitted **away from the black hole** and can **escape.** 

## X-ray emissions

The release of energy when materials swirl and crash into one another, in the form of low-energy soft x-rays.

## Neutron star

The explosion leaves behind a **rapidly spinning neutron star,** which rotates about 100 times per second.

## Pulsar

A rapidly spinning neutron star releases **pulses of energy** towards Earth, as beams of **electromagnetic radiation** (in the form of **light**). Due to the **rotation** of the neutron star, the beams **sweep past the Earth** at **regular intervals,** or in pulses, hence the name. The **time separation** between the pulses of a pulsar range from between 0.0014 seconds to 8.5 seconds.
