Stellar evolution is **a description of the way that stars change with time**. On human timescales, most stars do not appear to change at all, but if we were to look for billions of years, we would see how stars are born, how they age, and finally how they die.

## Molecular cloud

A molecular cloud is **an interstellar cloud of gas and dust in which molecules can form**, the most common of which is hydrogen (H2).

## Open cluster

An **open cluster** is a type of [star cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster) made of up to a few thousand [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) that were formed from the same [giant molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_molecular_cloud) and have roughly the same age. 

It consists of multiple **protostars,** which are **very young stars** that are still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud.

This is the **earliest phase** in the process of stellar evolution.

The process of **protostar formation** occurs as a result of gravity pulling together gases and dust into a ball. (Accretion forms nebulae) Gravitational energy begins to heat these gases as they come closer to the center, releasing radiation which simply escapes into space

As the infalling gas depletes, the protostar forms a pre-main-sequence star, which contracts to form a main-sequence star

## Brown dwarf

Brown Dwarfs are substellar objects as they are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion or ordinary hydrogen into helium. Hence, they instead rely on the fusion of deuterium and sometimes even lithium

Brown Dwarfs can appear in different colors to the naked eye, ranging from orange to possibly red when at high temperatures, to magenta at low temperatures

They may be fully convective, with no layers of chemical differentiation by depth

### The explanation for the inability to sustain hydrogen fusion:

After the formation of the pre-main-sequence star, thermonuclear fusion reactions within the core of the star will support it against any further gravitational contraction. Hydrostatic equilibrium is reached and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star.

However, normal hydrogen thermonuclear fusion reactions are unable to ignite the core in brown dwarfs as they have less than $0.08M_\odot$. Gravitational contraction does not heat the small protostar effectively. → Before it can reach a high enough temp to trigger fusion,  the density reaches the point where electrons are too closely packed together to create quantum electron degeneracy pressure. It is left to cool off radiating its internal energy out to space. i.e. it becomes a useless piece of mass.

## Low mass star 

Stars with less than eight solar masses, are the smallest, coolest, and dimmest Main sequence stars, and are usually orange, red, or brown in color. 

Formed when nebulae are small (but not too small)

Low mass stars use up their hydrogen fuel very slowly and consequently have long lives

Through the fusion of hydrogen into helium. A very good example would be our sun.

Large convection zones in comparison to massive stars

Low mass stars may not dominate the energy input into the interstellar medium, they constitute most of the total mass in our galaxy

## High mass star

Any star which is larger then eight solar masses is considered as a high mass star. It is formed when the nebulae is large

The temperature, luminosity and amount of time that it takes the star to expend its hydrogen is dependant upon the mass. A massive star will burn at an extremely high temperature. It will be beautifully luminous, but at a cost of its lifespan as it only lasts for a few million years. This is a very short time in comparison to smaller stars that can exist for billions of years.

## Red giant star

When the hydrogen fuel at the centre of a low mass star is exhausted, nuclear reactions start to move outwards into the atmosphere and burn the hydrogen thats in the shell surrounding the core. As a result, the outside of the star starts to expand and cool, turning much redder. It turns into a red giant, about 400 times larger then its original size.

As it expands, red giants will engulf some of their close-orbitting planets. In the case of the sun, the sun will engulf the planets of our solar system, including earth. But that wont happen for another 5 billion years so we dont really need to care. 

But as it expands, temperatures and pressure in the core starts to increase again making optimal conditions for fusion. This time its fuel becomes helium. But there isnt much helium in the core so the star can only survive for millions of years. Eventually, the core runs out and it repeats the process of nuclear reactions explaning out. Helium burns in the shell that surrounds the core, while hydrogen burn in the shell surrounding that shell. This is when it enters its secondary red giant phase

In this phase, it has 2 options. 

## Planetary nebula

An expanding, glowing shell of hot gas cast off during the death of a low mass star

Named planetary nebula as they look like smal planets when observed through a telescope, but in reality have nothing to actually do with the planet itself.

Highly unstable and begins to pulsate once it leaves the red giant phase, releasing stellar winds by ejecting its outer layers

Only survive for a few ten thousand years

The remaining core begins to shine brightly as it is very hot, at about 100 thousand degrees celsius. The core ejects ultraviolet light, which causes the planetary nebula to start glowing

## White dwarf

The remaining core after the planetary nebula ejects its outer layers is called a white dwarf. 

They are thought to make up of 6% of stars in the known stars neighbouring the sun

Made up of highly compressed carbon and oxygen, and are so dense their mass can be compared to the sun. 

Even though they have the hottest temperature, they are far away and hence appear very faint. However, they have to solely rely on their internal energy to maintain the heat and light released. As such, over time, they cool down and change colour

## Black dwarf

The result of the long term cooling down of the white dwarf. Eventually, the cool dark black dwarf will disappear from site. 

## Binary white dwarf

The result of when the red giant interacts with a white dwarf

They start orbiting each other, radiating gravitational waves

To balance this loss of energy, they start to come closer together. 

## Nova

The white dwarf draws material (hydrogen) from the red giant closer towards itself. 

That hydrogen accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, forming a thin atmosphere. 

The white dwarf heats the hydrogen, and eventually the gas pressure is extremely high, and fusion is ignited. Not just any fusion: rapid, runaway fusion.When the rapid fusion ignites, we can see the light, and the new hydrogen atmosphere is expelled away from the white dwarf into space. The star is NOT destroyed in the process.

In the past, astronomers thought these new bright lights were new stars, and the name "nova" stuck. This is an enormously energetic event, that produces not only visible light, but gamma rays and x-rays too. The end result is that some stars that could only be seen through a telescope can be seen with the naked eye during a nova.

The star can become a sole white dwarf, or can reenter into the binary star system.

## Type 1a Supernova

A white dwarf star pulls matter from a companion star until the dwarf’s dead core re-ignites in a thermonuclear explosion that destroys the star. This is similar to a nova but the explosion is much more powerful. A Type I supernova has no hydrogen in its spectrum. 

## Red Supergiant

Exact same as red giant im lazy to type it out. Instead of stopping at helium, they continue on to carbon and so on all the way to iron. They can no longer fuse elements, and they end up with only one option 

## Type II supernova

The core of the red supergiant consists of mostly just iron. That means the outward pull of gravity stops as there is no more fusion of elements to produce energy. Huge amount of energy is created during this process, allowing for the formation of new elements in the process. The outer layers collapse until it reaches the iron core. Since the core is too dense, the collapse of the outer layers will bounce off the surface at around 30000km/s, sending shockwaves through the star. The star explodes, brightening quickly, gradually fading away leaving the core by itself. The core forms either a neutron star of a black hole, depending on the mass of the remaining core. 

## Black hole

THe gravity is so strong that nothing can virtually get away from it, even light. This makes it so that we cannot see anything in this location. 

However, we can see the effects of the black hole on the surrounding universe, where the gravity of the black hole pulls clouds, dust and stars towards it. Materials swirl and crash into one another, producing heat and light. This light can be observed as it occurs away from the black hole and light can escape. 

## X-Ray emissions

Release of energy when materials swirl and crash into one another in the form of low energy soft x-rays.

## Neutron Star

Explosion of star leaves a rapidly spinning neutron star behind. Spins rapidly for about 100 times per second

## Pulsar

Rapidly spinning neutron star releases pulses of energy towards earth. Beams of electromagnetic radiation (in the form of light). Due to the rotation of the neutron star, the beams sweep past the Earth at regular intervals, or in pulses, hence the name. The time separation between the pulses of a pulsar range from between 0.0014 seconds to 8.5 seconds.
