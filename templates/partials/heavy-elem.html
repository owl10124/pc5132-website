<p><strong>Heavy elements</strong> refer to elements <strong>heavier than Fe-56.</strong> These are formed through the following three types of nucleosynthesis: <strong>r-process, s-process and p-process.</strong></p>
<h2 id='r-process-rapid-neutron-capture-process'>R-process (rapid neutron-capture process)</h2>
<p>R-process, or <strong>rapid neutron-capture process,</strong> is the <strong>primary</strong> process that results in the formation of heavy elements. It is capable of forming <strong>transuranic elements,</strong> which are elements with atomic numbers <strong>larger than 92</strong> (\(^{238}_{92}U\)). The resulting nuclei formed are known as <strong>r-nuclei</strong>, whose abundance distribution shows <strong>peaks</strong> at mass numbers <strong>80, 130 and 195.</strong> </p>
<p>The r-process starts off with a <strong>heavy seed nucleus</strong> (Fe-56 or heavier) capturing neutrons rapidly. The rapid capture of neutrons (hence the name of the process) means that the neutrons are being added to the nucleus at a <strong>faster</strong> rate than that of <strong>beta-decay,</strong> resulting in the formation of a <strong>neutron-rich</strong> nucleus. This will occur until the nucleus reaches the <strong>“waiting point”</strong>, which occurs at the <strong>neutron drip line,</strong> when <strong>no more neutrons can be added</strong> to the nucleus. At this point, <strong>binding energy</strong> is positive. </p>
<p>The nucleus then undergoes <strong>beta-decay</strong> and the neutrons are converted into protons and electrons. This increases its <strong>atomic number,</strong> thus increasing the <strong>charge</strong> on the nuclei and the <strong>value</strong> of the neutron-drip line. Therefore, the nuclei are able to <strong>capture more neutrons,</strong> repeating the process. </p>
<p>This leads to the formation of very <strong>neutron-rich radioactive nuclei</strong> that will eventually beta-decay towards the <strong>valley of beta stability.</strong> The r-process is terminated when the resulting nuclei become <strong>too unstable</strong> for neutron capture to occur, resulting in <strong>nuclear fission</strong> instead. </p>

<p>R-process occurs in <strong>high-entropy environments</strong> with high densities of neutrons, around \(10^{26}\) neutrons (\(\approx200g\)) per cm<sup>3</sup>. Thus, it is believed to occur during <strong>core-collapse supernovae</strong> and <strong>neutron-star mergers.</strong></p>
<h2 id='s-process-slow-neutron-capture-process'>S-process (slow neutron-capture process)</h2>
<p>S-process, also known as <strong>slow neutron-capture process,</strong> is a <strong>secondary</strong> process which requires <strong>pre-existing heavy isotopes</strong> as seed nuclei. As the name suggests, it is characterised by the slow capture of neutrons: here neutron capture occurs <strong>slower</strong> than <strong>beta decay.</strong></p>
<p>After a neutron capture, beta decay will occur until the isotope is <strong>stable.</strong> Similar to r-process, s-process results in the formation of <strong>neutron-rich nuclei.</strong> However, these nuclei are <strong>less neutron-rich</strong> than those formed in the r-process, and they are found in the <strong>valley of beta stability.</strong> Also, these nuclei will increase in mass <strong>1 unit at a time,</strong> unlike r-process, which will result in formation of nuclei <strong>much heavier</strong> than seed nuclei.</p>

<p>Unlike r-process, s-process is known to occur mainly in <strong>asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,</strong> where the <strong>neutron flux</strong> is sufficient for the slow capture.</p>
<h2 id='p-process'>P-process</h2>
<p>As the r- and s-processes form <strong>neutron-rich</strong> nuclei, they are <strong>unable</strong> to synthesise the 35 rare <strong>proton-rich isotopes</strong> known as <strong>p-nuclei.</strong> This is where <strong>p-process</strong> comes into play. </p>
<p>In contrast to the earlier two processes mentioned, the p-process is responsible for the production of proton-rich isotopes of heavy elements. While the mechanism is <strong>not fully understood,</strong> one possible method is through <strong>proton capture.</strong> This involves the capture of an incoming proton by seed nuclei. One such process is the <strong>rp-process,</strong> which stands for <strong>rapid proton capture process.</strong> Similar to r-process, this involves the <strong>capture of protons</strong> at a rate <strong>much faster than beta decay,</strong> resulting in proton-rich nuclei. </p>
<p>However, due to the <strong>increase in charge</strong> of the nuclei, causing <strong>increased repulsion</strong> for the next proton (as per Coulomb&#8217;s law), this process is <strong>not very efficient</strong> compared to the r-process and s-process. As a result, we observe <strong>fewer neutron-deficient</strong> heavy nuclei compared to <strong>neutron-rich</strong> heavy nuclei. </p>
<p>A more plausible mechanism for the p-process is <strong>photodisintegration.</strong> It involves <strong>seed nuclei absorbing</strong> a <strong>high energy photon,</strong> causing the nucleus to <strong>eject</strong> a <strong>subatomic particle,</strong> which is a <strong>proton, neutron, or alpha particle.</strong> The disintegration process is thought to occur in the <strong>O/Ne-rich zone</strong> of a massive star undergoing a <strong>Type II supernova explosion.</strong> As the <strong>supernova shock</strong> heats matter <strong>less</strong> as it moves out through the stellar radius, the <strong>innermost parts</strong> are <strong>heated more</strong> than the outermost parts. Thus, <strong>lighter</strong> p-nuclei are made in the innermost parts due to <strong>increased melting</strong> while the heavier p-nuclei are found in the outermost parts. </p>
