P-process forms neutron-deficient heavy elements (which can be radioactive). Any radioactive isotopes formed via s-process have very short half-lives. Thus, most of the heavy elements formed by s-process are neutron-rich, stable isotopes. R-process produces neutron-rich heavy element isotopes which are radioactive. As the half-lives for these isotopes are relatively long, this means that they will not decay immediately and make up most of the radioactive heavy element isotopes."
