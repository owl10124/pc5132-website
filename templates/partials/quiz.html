The outer layers collapse, resulting in the death of the star. Its mass usually doesn&#8217;t increase but <strong>decreases</strong> over time, due to ejection of matter or loss of <strong>electromagnetic radiation;</strong> certainly mass can be accreted from companion stars, but this is an exception from the norm.</p><p><small>by kai</small>"

Lighter stars cannot sustain these reactions, eventually losing all heat and forming — well — a useless piece of mass.</p><p><small>by kai</small>"

Though two alpha particles fuse to form beryllium-8, a <strong>third particle</strong> must fuse with it to form carbon-12, within a very short 8.19e−17 seconds; even then, the resultant carbon-12 is <strong>excited</strong> and will probably decompose anyway. There&#39;s a reason this is the <strong>slow step</strong>!</p><p>But once you have carbon-12, the hard part is done; now the other products are stable, so just add alpha particles one by one.</p><p>The other options are just random nonsense I made up on the spot, really.</p><p><small>by owl</small>"

Thus, most of the heavy elements formed by s-process are neutron-rich, stable isotopes. R-process produces neutron-rich heavy element isotopes which are radioactive.
