<p>Stellar evolution is <strong>a description of the way that stars change with time</strong>. On human timescales, most stars do not appear to change at all, but if we were to look for billions of years, we would see how stars are born, how they age, and finally how they die.</p>

<h2 id='molecular-cloud'>Molecular cloud</h2>
<p>A molecular cloud is <strong>an interstellar cloud of gas and dust in which molecules can form</strong>, the most common of which is hydrogen (H2).</p>
<h2 id='open-cluster'>Open cluster</h2>
<p>An <strong>open cluster</strong> is a type of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster'>star cluster</a> made of up to a few thousand <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star'>stars</a> that were formed from the same <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_molecular_cloud'>giant molecular cloud</a> and have roughly the same age. </p>
<p>It consists of multiple <strong>protostars,</strong> which are <strong>very young stars</strong> that are still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud.</p>
<p>This is the <strong>earliest phase</strong> in the process of stellar evolution.</p>
<p>The process of <strong>protostar formation</strong> occurs as a result of gravity pulling together gases and dust into a ball. (Accretion forms nebulae) Gravitational energy begins to heat these gases as they come closer to the center, releasing radiation which simply escapes into space</p>
<p>As the infalling gas depletes, the protostar forms a pre-main-sequence star, which contracts to form a main-sequence star</p>
<h2 id='brown-dwarf'>Brown dwarf</h2>
<p>Brown Dwarfs are substellar objects as they are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion or ordinary hydrogen into helium. Hence, they instead rely on the fusion of deuterium and sometimes even lithium</p>
<p>Brown Dwarfs can appear in different colors to the naked eye, ranging from orange to possibly red when at high temperatures, to magenta at low temperatures</p>
<p>They may be fully convective, with no layers of chemical differentiation by depth</p>
<h3 id='the-explanation-for-the-inability-to-sustain-hydrogen-fusion'>The explanation for the inability to sustain hydrogen fusion:</h3>
<p>After the formation of the pre-main-sequence star, thermonuclear fusion reactions within the core of the star will support it against any further gravitational contraction. Hydrostatic equilibrium is reached and the star will spend most of its lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium as a main-sequence star.</p>
<p>However, normal hydrogen thermonuclear fusion reactions are unable to ignite the core in brown dwarfs as they have less than <mjx-container class="MathJax" jax="SVG" style="position: relative;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="7.65ex" height="2.017ex" role="img" focusable="false" viewBox="0 -683 3381.1 891.7" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" aria-hidden="true" style="vertical-align: -0.472ex;"><defs><path id="MJX-34-TEX-N-30" d="M96 585Q152 666 249 666Q297 666 345 640T423 548Q460 465 460 320Q460 165 417 83Q397 41 362 16T301 -15T250 -22Q224 -22 198 -16T137 16T82 83Q39 165 39 320Q39 494 96 585ZM321 597Q291 629 250 629Q208 629 178 597Q153 571 145 525T137 333Q137 175 145 125T181 46Q209 16 250 16Q290 16 318 46Q347 76 354 130T362 333Q362 478 354 524T321 597Z"></path><path id="MJX-34-TEX-N-2E" d="M78 60Q78 84 95 102T138 120Q162 120 180 104T199 61Q199 36 182 18T139 0T96 17T78 60Z"></path><path id="MJX-34-TEX-N-38" d="M70 417T70 494T124 618T248 666Q319 666 374 624T429 515Q429 485 418 459T392 417T361 389T335 371T324 363L338 354Q352 344 366 334T382 323Q457 264 457 174Q457 95 399 37T249 -22Q159 -22 101 29T43 155Q43 263 172 335L154 348Q133 361 127 368Q70 417 70 494ZM286 386L292 390Q298 394 301 396T311 403T323 413T334 425T345 438T355 454T364 471T369 491T371 513Q371 556 342 586T275 624Q268 625 242 625Q201 625 165 599T128 534Q128 511 141 492T167 463T217 431Q224 426 228 424L286 386ZM250 21Q308 21 350 55T392 137Q392 154 387 169T375 194T353 216T330 234T301 253T274 270Q260 279 244 289T218 306L210 311Q204 311 181 294T133 239T107 157Q107 98 150 60T250 21Z"></path><path id="MJX-34-TEX-I-1D440" d="M289 629Q289 635 232 637Q208 637 201 638T194 648Q194 649 196 659Q197 662 198 666T199 671T201 676T203 679T207 681T212 683T220 683T232 684Q238 684 262 684T307 683Q386 683 398 683T414 678Q415 674 451 396L487 117L510 154Q534 190 574 254T662 394Q837 673 839 675Q840 676 842 678T846 681L852 683H948Q965 683 988 683T1017 684Q1051 684 1051 673Q1051 668 1048 656T1045 643Q1041 637 1008 637Q968 636 957 634T939 623Q936 618 867 340T797 59Q797 55 798 54T805 50T822 48T855 46H886Q892 37 892 35Q892 19 885 5Q880 0 869 0Q864 0 828 1T736 2Q675 2 644 2T609 1Q592 1 592 11Q592 13 594 25Q598 41 602 43T625 46Q652 46 685 49Q699 52 704 61Q706 65 742 207T813 490T848 631L654 322Q458 10 453 5Q451 4 449 3Q444 0 433 0Q418 0 415 7Q413 11 374 317L335 624L267 354Q200 88 200 79Q206 46 272 46H282Q288 41 289 37T286 19Q282 3 278 1Q274 0 267 0Q265 0 255 0T221 1T157 2Q127 2 95 1T58 0Q43 0 39 2T35 11Q35 13 38 25T43 40Q45 46 65 46Q135 46 154 86Q158 92 223 354T289 629Z"></path><path id="MJX-34-TEX-N-2299" d="M56 250Q56 394 156 488T384 583Q530 583 626 485T722 250Q722 110 625 14T390 -83Q249 -83 153 14T56 250ZM682 250Q682 322 649 387T546 497T381 542Q272 542 184 459T95 250Q95 132 178 45T389 -42Q515 -42 598 45T682 250ZM311 250Q311 285 332 304T375 328Q376 328 382 328T392 329Q424 326 445 305T466 250Q466 217 445 195T389 172Q354 172 333 195T311 250Z"></path></defs><g stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" transform="scale(1,-1)"><g data-mml-node="math"><g data-mml-node="mn"><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-N-30"></use><use data-c="2E" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-N-2E" transform="translate(500,0)"></use><use data-c="30" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-N-30" transform="translate(778,0)"></use><use data-c="38" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-N-38" transform="translate(1278,0)"></use></g><g data-mml-node="msub" transform="translate(1778,0)"><g data-mml-node="mi"><use data-c="1D440" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-I-1D440"></use></g><g data-mml-node="mo" transform="translate(1003,-150) scale(0.707)"><use data-c="2299" xlink:href="#MJX-34-TEX-N-2299"></use></g></g></g></g></svg></mjx-container><script type="math/tex">0.08M_\odot</script>. Gravitational contraction does not heat the small protostar effectively. â†’ Before it can reach a high enough temp to trigger fusion,  the density reaches the point where electrons are too closely packed together to create quantum electron degeneracy pressure. It is left to cool off radiating its internal energy out to space. i.e. it becomes a useless piece of mass.</p>
<h2 id='low-mass-star'>Low mass star </h2>
<p>Stars with less than eight solar masses, are the smallest, coolest, and dimmest Main sequence stars, and are usually orange, red, or brown in color. </p>
<p>Formed when nebulae are small (but not too small)</p>
<p>Low mass stars use up their hydrogen fuel very slowly and consequently have long lives</p>
<p>Through the fusion of hydrogen into helium. A very good example would be our sun.</p>
<p>Large convection zones in comparison to massive stars</p>
<p>Low mass stars may not dominate the energy input into the interstellar medium, they constitute most of the total mass in our galaxy</p>
<h2 id='high-mass-star'>High mass star</h2>
<p>Any star which is larger then eight solar masses is considered as a high mass star. It is formed when the nebulae is large</p>
<p>The temperature, luminosity and amount of time that it takes the star to expend its hydrogen is dependant upon the mass. A massive star will burn at an extremely high temperature. It will be beautifully luminous, but at a cost of its lifespan as it only lasts for a few million years. This is a very short time in comparison to smaller stars that can exist for billions of years.</p>
<h2 id='red-giant-star'>Red giant star</h2>
<p>When the hydrogen fuel at the centre of a low mass star is exhausted, nuclear reactions start to move outwards into the atmosphere and burn the hydrogen thats in the shell surrounding the core. As a result, the outside of the star starts to expand and cool, turning much redder. It turns into a red giant, about 400 times larger then its original size.</p>
<p>As it expands, red giants will engulf some of their close-orbitting planets. In the case of the sun, the sun will engulf the planets of our solar system, including earth. But that wont happen for another 5 billion years so we dont really need to care. </p>
<p>But as it expands, temperatures and pressure in the core starts to increase again making optimal conditions for fusion. This time its fuel becomes helium. But there isnt much helium in the core so the star can only survive for millions of years. Eventually, the core runs out and it repeats the process of nuclear reactions explaning out. Helium burns in the shell that surrounds the core, while hydrogen burn in the shell surrounding that shell. This is when it enters its secondary red giant phase</p>
<p>In this phase, it has 2 options. </p>
<h2 id='planetary-nebula'>Planetary nebula</h2>
<p>An expanding, glowing shell of hot gas cast off during the death of a low mass star</p>
<p>Named planetary nebula as they look like smal planets when observed through a telescope, but in reality have nothing to actually do with the planet itself.</p>
<p>Highly unstable and begins to pulsate once it leaves the red giant phase, releasing stellar winds by ejecting its outer layers</p>
<p>Only survive for a few ten thousand years</p>
<p>The remaining core begins to shine brightly as it is very hot, at about 100 thousand degrees celsius. The core ejects ultraviolet light, which causes the planetary nebula to start glowing</p>
<h2 id='white-dwarf'>White dwarf</h2>
<p>The remaining core after the planetary nebula ejects its outer layers is called a white dwarf. </p>
<p>They are thought to make up of 6% of stars in the known stars neighbouring the sun</p>
<p>Made up of highly compressed carbon and oxygen, and are so dense their mass can be compared to the sun. </p>
<p>Even though they have the hottest temperature, they are far away and hence appear very faint. However, they have to solely rely on their internal energy to maintain the heat and light released. As such, over time, they cool down and change colour</p>
<h2 id='black-dwarf'>Black dwarf</h2>
<p>The result of the long term cooling down of the white dwarf. Eventually, the cool dark black dwarf will disappear from site. </p>
<h2 id='binary-white-dwarf'>Binary white dwarf</h2>
<p>The result of when the red giant interacts with a white dwarf</p>
<p>They start orbiting each other, radiating gravitational waves</p>
<p>To balance this loss of energy, they start to come closer together. </p>
<h2 id='nova'>Nova</h2>
<p>The white dwarf draws material (hydrogen) from the red giant closer towards itself. </p>
<p>That hydrogen accretes onto the surface of the white dwarf, forming a thin atmosphere. </p>
<p>The white dwarf heats the hydrogen, and eventually the gas pressure is extremely high, and fusion is ignited. Not just any fusion: rapid, runaway fusion.When the rapid fusion ignites, we can see the light, and the new hydrogen atmosphere is expelled away from the white dwarf into space. The star is NOT destroyed in the process.</p>
<p>In the past, astronomers thought these new bright lights were new stars, and the name &quot;nova&quot; stuck. This is an enormously energetic event, that produces not only visible light, but gamma rays and x-rays too. The end result is that some stars that could only be seen through a telescope can be seen with the naked eye during a nova.</p>
<p>The star can become a sole white dwarf, or can reenter into the binary star system.</p>
<h2 id='type-1a-supernova'>Type 1a Supernova</h2>
<p>A white dwarf star pulls matter from a companion star until the dwarfâ€™s dead core re-ignites in a thermonuclear explosion that destroys the star. This is similar to a nova but the explosion is much more powerful. A Type I supernova has no hydrogen in its spectrum. </p>
<h2 id='red-supergiant'>Red Supergiant</h2>
<p>Exact same as red giant im lazy to type it out. Instead of stopping at helium, they continue on to carbon and so on all the way to iron. They can no longer fuse elements, and they end up with only one option </p>
<h2 id='type-ii-supernova'>Type II supernova</h2>
<p>The core of the red supergiant consists of mostly just iron. That means the outward pull of gravity stops as there is no more fusion of elements to produce energy. Huge amount of energy is created during this process, allowing for the formation of new elements in the process. The outer layers collapse until it reaches the iron core. Since the core is too dense, the collapse of the outer layers will bounce off the surface at around 30000km/s, sending shockwaves through the star. The star explodes, brightening quickly, gradually fading away leaving the core by itself. The core forms either a neutron star of a black hole, depending on the mass of the remaining core. </p>
<h2 id='black-hole'>Black hole</h2>
<p>THe gravity is so strong that nothing can virtually get away from it, even light. This makes it so that we cannot see anything in this location. </p>
<p>However, we can see the effects of the black hole on the surrounding universe, where the gravity of the black hole pulls clouds, dust and stars towards it. Materials swirl and crash into one another, producing heat and light. This light can be observed as it occurs away from the black hole and light can escape. </p>
<h2 id='x-ray-emissions'>X-Ray emissions</h2>
<p>Release of energy when materials swirl and crash into one another in the form of low energy soft x-rays.</p>
<h2 id='neutron-star'>Neutron Star</h2>
<p>Explosion of star leaves a rapidly spinning neutron star behind. Spins rapidly for about 100 times per second</p>
<h2 id='pulsar'>Pulsar</h2>
<p>Rapidly spinning neutron star releases pulses of energy towards earth. Beams of electromagnetic radiation (in the form of light). Due to the rotation of the neutron star, the beams sweep past the Earth at regular intervals, or in pulses, hence the name. The time separation between the pulses of a pulsar range from between 0.0014 seconds to 8.5 seconds.</p>
